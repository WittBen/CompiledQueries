# CompiledQueries

This repository demonstrates the use of compiled queries in Entity Framework Core to enhance performance. By compiling queries, the project reduces overhead associated with query translation and execution, making it especially useful in high-performance applications with repetitive queries. The repository provides benchmarks and practical examples, helping developers understand how to implement compiled queries effectively.
